## Introduction
Hi,
I have implemented a flight booking system with rails.
With this app, you can search for flights with or without dates. The  number of passengers you select will determine the number of passenger fields you'll have on your booking form.
On successful booking of a flight, you will recieve a booking-success email.
You will also have the option of paying via paypal or to proceed to your profile.
The app has features to handle cancelling a booking before the day of the flight and also managing the number of passengers on a booking.
You will also recieve a booking update email if you choose to manage your app.
Check out the cool [app here](https://matflights.herokuapp.com/)!
Bug discoveries, suggestions and general feedback will always be appreciated.

Olaide.

## Getting Started
Getting started is extremely easy, you can either clone / fork this repository or download the entire project as a zip package and run locally.

## Dependencies
This project is implemented using the rails framework and as such in order to effectively run this project locally, you need to have a version of Rails running on your local development machine. You also need to make sure that you have the Ruby programming language installed as rails is written in ruby.

* [Get Ruby Here](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
* [Get Rails Here](http://rubyonrails.org/)

You also need to make sure that you have rubygems and bundler installed. RubyGems is a package management framework for Ruby and bundler is a ruby gem that helps to manage other external dependencies in a rails application.

* [Get Rubygems Here](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)
* [Get Bundler Here](http://bundler.io/)

Once you have a copy of this project and it's dependencies installed, you are good. Start up your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install all the required external dependencies.

`bundle`

Once done, run the following command to prepare the database on your machine.

`rake db:migrate`

Then run the following command to preload the database with data.

`rake db:seed`



** Note: To view the project in a web browser, you need to get the rails server up and running. Run the following command from the terminal and browse to the generated link from a web browser.

`rails s`

## Running the tests.

After all the setting up as mentioned above, you can run the tests. The tests are driven by rspec, capybara and selenium. You can get them fired up by running the following command from the terminal.

`rspec spec`

or

`bundle exec rspec`

or

`rake`

If you need more specific tests, then specify the absolute path to the spec file:

`bundle exec rspec spec/models/booking_spec.rb`

If you want the tests to read more like a document then pass in these options to the rspec command:

`bundle exec rspec spec/models/booking_spec.rb -f documentation`
